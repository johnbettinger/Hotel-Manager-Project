# Hotel Manager Project

A project to simulate how a hotel functions. The application works to store hotel reservations, receive guests upon check in, and check out guests when they leave. This project was done with pair programming and Agile methodologies. Extensive unit testing and refactoring was performed over the course of 3 months.
